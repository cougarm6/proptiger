    <issue
        id="AllowBackup"
        severity="Warning"
        message="On SDK version 23 and up, your app data will be automatically backed up and restored on app install. Consider adding the attribute `android:fullBackupContent` to specify an `@xml` resource which configures which files to backup. More info: https://developer.android.com/preview/backup/index.html"
        category="Security"
        priority="3"
        summary="AllowBackup/FullBackupContent Problems"
        explanation="The `allowBackup` attribute determines if an application&apos;s data can be backed up and restored. It is documented at http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#allowBackup

By default, this flag is set to `true`. When this flag is set to `true`, application data can be backed up and restored by the user using `adb backup` and `adb restore`.

This may have security consequences for an application. `adb backup` allows users who have enabled USB debugging to copy application data off of the device. Once backed up, all application data can be read by the user. `adb restore` allows creation of application data from a source specified by the user. Following a restore, applications should not assume that the data, file permissions, and directory permissions were created by the application itself.

Setting `allowBackup=&quot;false&quot;` opts an application out of both backup and restore.

To fix this warning, decide whether your application should support backup, and explicitly set `android:allowBackup=(true|false)&quot;`.

If not set to false, and if targeting API 23 or later, lint will also warn that you should set `android:fullBackupContent` to configure auto backup."

        category="Internationalization"
        priority="5"
        summary="Hardcoded text"
        explanation="Hardcoding text attributes directly in layout files is bad for several reasons:

* When creating configuration variations (for example for landscape or portrait)you have to repeat the actual text (and keep it up to date when making changes)

* The application cannot be translated to other languages by just adding new translations for existing string resources.

In Android Studio and Eclipse there are quickfixes to automatically extract this hardcoded string into a resource lookup."
